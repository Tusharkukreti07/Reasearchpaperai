Tips & Heuristics for Document Analysis (for the AI Assistant):
Author Identification (Page 1, Top Section):

The names at the top of the first page, usually below the title, are author names.

Author affiliations often follow as footnotes, superscripts, or appear below their names.

Emails (e.g., @university.edu) help confirm author lines.

Title Detection:

The largest bold text on the first page, usually centered and before author names, is the title of the paper.

Titles are often in Title Case or ALL CAPS in some formats.

Abstract Extraction:

Look for the word "Abstract" near the beginning — the paragraph that follows is the abstract.

Abstract usually ends before the keywords or introduction.

Section Headers:

Use headings like “1. Introduction”, “2. Related Work”, etc., to break the document into sections.

Look for consistent numbered or bold/underlined headers.

Figures and Tables:

“Figure X” or “Table X” is followed by a caption — treat these as key insights.

Sometimes the discussion around figures contains core results.

Citation Format Recognition:

APA/IEEE/MLA style citations may appear like:

[1], (Smith et al., 2020), or Smith (2020)

Helps in identifying related work or source credibility.

References Section:

Starts with "References", “Bibliography” or “Works Cited”.

Begins at the end of the paper and usually lists all cited works.

Keywords:

Look for a line starting with “Keywords:” after the abstract — extract terms for tagging and semantic search.

Mathematical Equations:

Inline or centered equations are usually between dollar signs or LaTeX notation ($$, \begin{equation}).

Surrounding text gives context to model assumptions or formulas.

Conclusion Section:

Usually titled “Conclusion” or “Discussion and Future Work”.

Contains final thoughts, findings, and suggestions.

Acknowledgments:

Usually found before references — can be skipped in semantic summarization unless important.

Affiliation-Based Filtering:

If multiple institutions are listed, assume a collaborative paper — useful for network analysis.

PDF Formatting Notes:

Beware of multi-column layouts — process left column before right.

Footnotes and headers (journal names, page numbers) should be filtered out.
