Create a full-stack web application named "Research Paper AI Agent" — a smart academic research assistant. The app should use AI to assist users in reading, analyzing, and managing research papers.

✅ Core Features:
📤 PDF Upload & Extraction

Allow users to upload multiple research papers (PDF format).

Extract text using PyMuPDF or pdfplumber (fallback to OCR like Tesseract if text is non-selectable).

🧠 AI-Powered Summarization

Summarize uploaded papers into:

Bullet-point summaries

Section-wise summaries

Graphical abstracts (optional: integrate with image generation APIs)

🔍 Semantic Search

Implement full-text and vector-based semantic search using FAISS, Chroma, or Weaviate.

Return the most relevant passages or documents with highlighted context.

📚 Citation & Reference Generator

Extract citations from the paper.
